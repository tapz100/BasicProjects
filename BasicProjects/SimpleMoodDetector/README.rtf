What you'll build

A tiny AI that:

Asks the user questions like
“Did you sleep well?”, “Are you hungry?”, “Is today stressful?”

Uses boolean logic to “guess” what mood the person is in

Outputs moods like Happy, Tired, Stressed, Hungry, etc.

🔍 Key learning

You'll practice:

Converting “yes/no” to boolean values

Combining boolean expressions
Example:

if slept_well == "yes" and hungry == "no":
    mood = "Happy"

🧠 Why this fits your current skills

You’re basically creating decision logic — like a small rule-based AI system — using only comparisons and boolean operators.


Algorithm:

1. Start
2. Print “Did you sleep well?”
3. If yes - the set mood to happy and exit, if no - set mood to Tired and exit
4. exit
