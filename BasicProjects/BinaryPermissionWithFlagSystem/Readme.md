🎯 What you build

A mini system that:

Assigns permissions using bitwise operators

Checks which features a user can access

🧠 Example idea

Each permission is a number:

Read = 1

Write = 2

Execute = 4

Combine permissions:

Read + Write = 3

Full access = 7

Check permissions using:

& (AND)

| (OR)

🔑 Skills used

Bitwise operators (& | ^ << >>)

Assignment

Logical operators

📌 Why this is advanced:
This is how real operating systems and AI pipelines manage permissions.
